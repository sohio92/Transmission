# Transmission
A simulation of a disease spreading with the stats being printed on the graph.

Just hit the 'Lancer' button to launch the simulation and use the 'Nombre de malades' slider start the spreading.
I didn't have time to correct a graphical bug that sometimes occurs on the graph when you change the number of balls 'Nombre de boules'.

Sorry if the code is a bit messy, I put it together in a day or two and hadn't used the tkinter library in a while.
